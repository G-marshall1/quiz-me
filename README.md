# quiz-me

## Description

- I love making quizes to test my knowledge and to continuely prove to myself that I can push myself past my limits
- I chose to create a coding quiz because its use of local storage and the use of implementing Jquery. 
- I desided to create coding quiz to show my practical knowledge of Jquery
- By making this page, I learned how to implement multiple string arrays in form of answers and questions along with logging data and having it reflect not only in the console but on the page as well.
